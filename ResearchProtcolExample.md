## PESD Research Protocol
This is a protocol template for conducting case based research related to the Privacy Encodings for Sensitive Data Project (PESD).  The goal is to systematize the collection of data about different disciplines, domains, or even institutions so that we can generalize from the needs of any one case to develop services and tools to better support the sharing, reuse, and long-term preservation of qualitative (and mixed methods) research data.  

Researchers involved in developing a new PESD case should, in advance of collecting data, use this template to define key terms, describe the logic of sampling a population, assign research roles and responsibilities, etc. The protocol should be published as a markdown document to a new github repository where all team members can see, comment on, and contribute. Protocols should be updated during the course of the data collection or analysis, but be sure to keep a log of changes. 

---

Each case protocol should contain the following elements


**Title** : Title of the case 

**Researcher Roles & Responsibilties**: Who is responsible for what tasks in carrying out this protocol? 

**Case Objective**: The description of the case should include 1-3 paragraphs of narrative that provides background information about the logic of selecting this case and how it fits into the PESD work overall. 

**Case Background**: The description should also include 2-5 paragraphs about the subjects - who makes up the case, what kinds of research methods are used, what kinds of research questions are asked, who is the audience for this research, what are their current data practices, what are the presumed challenges to sharing / reusing / archiving data, etc. These should be preliminary thoughts or ideas that are inferred from background reading or background conversations / experience of the PESD research team. 

**Units**       
- A *unit of analysis* is the subject of a case study. 
- A *unit of observation* is individual measures of the subject (Long, 2004).
- Most cases in PESD will focused on a bounded group with established or emerging information norms (e.g. a discipline, an institution, a domain of researchers focused on a type of data, etc.). Individual units of observation will likely be members of that group. 

**Sample Design and Procedures**: Who constitutes the study population, or unit of observation (if there are any factors that disqualify someone from participating what are they and why)? What is the intended sample size and the rationale for the sample size calculation? How will respondents be located, recruited and selected?

**Data Collection Method**: Most PESD research will use interviews and archival document analysis as method of data collection. However, it may be useful to document some particular strategies or approaches that will be used for a particular case. 

**Interview Table**: The interview table should be an updated list of potential participants, how and when they were recruited (status), where interview was conducted, length of an interview, format of interview, a link to background materials that were used to prepare for interview, link to transcript, etc. It is likely easier to keep this in a google doc - so if this is the case please just provide a link and description of the attributes that are collected for each interviewee. (see example from Bleich and Pekannen, 2015) 

**Participant Codes**: Each PESD participant will receive a code that should be used to label files and references to a person (so as to provide some level of privacy). In the `PESD/Logistics` repository there is a document that explains the logic of creating a new code, and a spreadsheet to log all participant codes. Be sure to:
1. Create a new code for a new case, and record that code in your protocol; and,
2. Update both of the documentation and the spreadsheet when enrolling participants in a new case.  

**Participant Profile**: 
In preparation for an interview a profile should be developed for each participant. The contents of a profile may vary from case to case, but should include things like:
- Institutional affiliation
- Professional Title
- Career / education history: What field did they get(ting) their PhD in, what department are they affiliated, how do they self describe on website, etc.
- Current research project: This will be useful for interviews that take a critical incident approach. 

**CI Scenarios**
Part of what makes PESD research, and in particular interviews, is our attempt to capture information norms through Contextual Integrity (CI) scenerious. There will be more extensive documentation about this in the `PESD/Logistics` repository, but for the sake of a case protocol what should be recorded is the Contextual Ontology of a given case. This will be a list of values for each parameter in the CI framework, including : 
- Data Subject: What is the data about, what kinds of sensitive information might it contain, etc  
- Senders of Data: Role played by an individual
- Receivers of Data: Role played by an individual 
- Information Objects: types or formats of data that may be sent)
- Transmission Principles: the logic of sharing / transferring /trading data)

**Plan for Analysis**: In short, how will the case be analyzed and what are the plans for integration with other cases? Most PESD cases should be designed so that they are coherent as a standalone case study. Between case comparisons can be describe in later revisions to the protocol if they are not immediately clear. 

**Data Management**: Record what data will be stored where, by whom, and who should have access. For most documentation the Github repository for the case will be the most convenient option for all PESD team members. For data that contain personally identifiable information there should be an encrypted option. A link for shared access should be added to the github repository (or shared via email with team members). 

**Schedule of completion**: The section should record a date to begin and end data collection, analysis, and writing up of results. It is important to try to establish a loose timeline so different team members can track progress and plan when they might propose or start a new case. Please try to note external events that might drive analysis (e.g. a deadline for a special issue of a journal). Ideally the schedule of completion can be translated into issues / milestones that are linked to the github repository, but that can happen as the case is up and running.
